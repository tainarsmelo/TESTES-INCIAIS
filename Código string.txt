# The following 5 lines assign strings to a list of variables.
salutation = "Dr."
first_name = "Prisha"
middle_name = "Jai"
last_name = "Agarwal"
suffix = "Ph.D."
 
print(salutation + " " + first_name + " " + middle_name + " " + last_name + ", " + suffix) 




# The comma as a string ", " adds the conventional use of a comma plus a 
# space to separate the last name from the suffix.
 
# Alternatively, you could use commas in place of the + connector:
# print(salutation, " ", first_name, " ", middle_name, " ", last_name, 
# ", ", suffix)
# 
# As a third option, you could add the spaces to the variables:
# salutation= "Dr. "
# first_name = "Prisha "
# middle_name = "Jai "
# last_name = "Agarwal "
# suffix = "Ph.D."
# print(salutation, first_name, middle_name, last_name, ", ", suffix)
# or
# print(salutation + first_name + middle_name + last_name + ", ", + 
# suffix)
